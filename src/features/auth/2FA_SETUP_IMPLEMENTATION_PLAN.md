## Integration Points

### Backend Integration

- [x] `securityService.setup2FA()` - For QR code generation (connected in Settings.tsx)
- [x] `securityService.verify2FA()` - For code verification
- [x] `securityService.generateBackupCodes()` - For backup codes
- [x] `securityService.getSecurityScore()` - For updating security score (already in Settings.tsx)

### State Management

- [x] User preferences for 2FA status (via Settings.tsx)
- [x] Temporary setup state (via component state)
- [x] Verification attempts tracking
- [x] Backup codes state

## Success Criteria

1. ⏳ Users can successfully enable 2FA (In Progress)
